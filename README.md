# *Welcome to my app project*

[**TravPath App**](https://derokev.github.io/travpath/)
I decided to do a app that not only would help myself learn but also help at my current job. The TravPath app 
is basically going to be a todo app with added functionality. 

## *TravPath*
TravPath short for Travel Path is a work routine in which a ranking employee walks the business property looking for any opportunities, risks, etc to Take appropriate actions to better serve guest, customers, etc.
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Derokev/travpath/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Derokev/travpath/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
